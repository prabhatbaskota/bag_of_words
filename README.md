# Bag of Words Spam Detection

This project implements a **spam detection model** using the **Bag of Words** approach with **unigrams** (single words). The aim is to classify text messages such as emails or SMS as **spam** or **not spam**.

### Key Features
- Uses `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn to extract features using unigram representation.
- Trains a classification model (e.g., SVM) to detect spam messages.
- Simple and easy-to-follow structure suitable for beginners in NLP and machine learning.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset
A labeled dataset of text messages is used where each message is tagged as `spam` or `no_spam`.
Dataset will be increased eventually.
